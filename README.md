# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

# Module 12 Challenge

# Purpose

Roza's biological research lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food
startup, to analyze bacteria from the belly button that synthesizes proteins.
Other bacteria such as fungi have been successfully used to manufacture other 
products however the hypothesis is this specific bacterial species may
be used to manufacture synthetic beef. Volunteer data has been collected 
and the demographic data provided to build a dashboard.

All subject data is anonymous with subject IDs instead of name. The 
demographic data was provided with other other data reflected in three 
different charts. A bar chart shows the Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found;
a bubble chart to show Bacteria Culters Per Sample and a a gauge chart
to show the Belly Button Washing Frequency. 

The dashboard selection is pre-loaded volunteer is ID 940 with corresponding
data reflected in the bar chart, bubble chart and gauge chart. When selecting 
another ID from the dropdown, each chart reflects data specific to that ID.
